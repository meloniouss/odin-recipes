        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These buttermilk pancakes are passed down from my grandmother, who was fully Scandinavian.</p><p> They are light and fluffy, and great with berry syrups.</p><p>I have made these for years as a special treat, and I hope you enjoy them as much as my family has.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 â…› cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat and lightly grease a large skillet or electric griddle.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Add egg, buttermilk, and butter; stir together lightly, but keep it lumpy. The batter should look thick, spongy, and puffy.</li>
            <li>Drop 1/3 cup of the batter onto the cooking surface, spreading lightly with the bottom of the cup. Cook until lightly browned on each side, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
