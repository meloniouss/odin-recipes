    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics first.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated jumbo buttermilk biscuits</li>
        <li>1 (9.6 ounce) package Jimmy Dean® Original Hearty Pork Sausage Crumbles</li>
        <li>¼ cup flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange biscuits 1 to 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until thoroughly heated, stirring frequently, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour until well combined. Gradually add milk, stirring continuously, until the gravy thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer and stir for 2 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Split biscuits in half. Place 2 halves on each of 8 plates; top with about 1/3 cup gravy.</li>
    </ul>
